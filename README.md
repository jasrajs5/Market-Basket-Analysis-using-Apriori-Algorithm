This is a project on market basket analysis using apriori algorithm 
Libraries used in this are as follows:
numpy, pandas, seaborn, maplotlib, mlxtend(for association apriori algo),networkx for visualization

In Market Basket Analysis, three key metrics help evaluate association rules:
1) Support: The proportion of transactions that contain both the antecedent (if part) and consequent (then part) of the rule.
   Example: If 100 customers made purchases and 20 bought both milk and bread, the support is 0.2 (20%).

2) Confidence: The likelihood that item B is purchased when item A is purchased.
   Example: If 50 customers bought milk and out of those, 20 bought bread as well, the confidence is 0.4 (40%).
